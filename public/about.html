<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Wisdom Emmanuel — a WordPress developer 
  specializing in building custom directory and listing 
  websites with WordPress and Brilliant Directories. I focus on creating user-friendly, multilingual 
  platforms using themes like MyListing and tools like WPML 
  and WS Form.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on projects such as 
  <a href="https://conectahonduras.com/">ConectaHonduras.com</a>, 
  a Spanish-language classified ads platform, and 
  <a href="https://www.hourlycaregivers.com/">HourlyCaregivers.com</a>, a service directory connecting 
  caregivers with clients. From full theme setup to advanced 
  customization, I build solutions that are not only 
  functional but also scalable and easy to manage.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about clean design, responsive layouts, and 
  solving real-world problems through smart web development.</p>
